# myregrinv
Resolve a calibration problem (inverse regression problem) that
is: to estimate mean value and confidence interval of x since y.
This function computes a least-square linear regression using the
supplied calibration points and then computes the X values for a supplied
y observed vector. This routine uses MYREGR function. If it is not present on
the computer, myregrinv will try to download it from FEX
